Perona
 (ãƒšãƒ­ãƒ¼ãƒŠ) 
Birthday:	
June 7th
is a member of the Mysterious Four led by the Warlord Gecko Moria and former Commander of the Wild Zombies and Surprise Zombies in Moria's Zombie army. She possesses the power of the Hollow-Hollow Fruit, a Paramecia Devil Fruit which allows her to produce ghosts known as Hollows, thus making her a Ghost Human. Her dream is to create a country where all the "cute" people in the world are turned into zombie animals that obey only her.

Her Negative Hollows allow her to depress people that come in contact with them, making her a particularly dangerous foe. During her battle with Usopp, she finds that her powers have no effect on him due to his natural pessimism, thus making him her natural enemy. She is defeated by him and later tries to flee on the Straw Hats' ship, Thousand Sunny during the Special Zombie Oars rampage. She encounters Bartholomew Kuma who uses his powers to send her to a island with a spooky castle after asking where she would like to go. She later befriends Roronoa Zoro when he is sent to the same island and the two discover that the castle is home to Zoro's rival, Dracule Mihawk. She stays on the island with Zoro and Mihawk during the Straw Hats two-years of training, nursing Zoro's injuries and later helps him reach Sabaody Archipelago to reunite with his crew and helped the Straw Hats in their escape by using her Negative Hollows on the Marines.
